Look at the code and compile it or just download it and run the exe within the build folder. Just place the screenshot you want to convert in the same folder as the exe and then type the full name of the screenshot out when you launch the application, including the extension. The screenshot should ONLY contain the tiles on the board, and nothing else outside of those tiles. Look at the test.jpg image in the build folder for an example. Should work with pretty much any image type. Thanks.

Example:
"test.jpg"
